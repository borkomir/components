# VueTailwind.com

Fully responsive and beautiful HTML components made with VueJS and Tailwindcss.

### Why use VueTailwind.com?

Here are a few reasons:

- No installation is required! Just browse components, and copy and paste the code for those components that you like.
- Countless designs for both basic web components such as buttons, and advanced components such as photo gallery.
- Open source! Both VueJS and Tailwind are open-source, why not make VueTailwind open-source?! Eventually every component will be hosted on Github and you can send PRs for it.

### How much will it cost?
Every component is completely **free** under **MIT** license. You may use them for whatever need you have.
